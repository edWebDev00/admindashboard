# admindashboard
## What is it
A basic admin dashboard with a menu, header, and main section.  The menu has three sections including a title and two navigation sections.  THe header features a search bar, notification section, welcome message, and buttons for further navigation.  The main section features a series of cards with actionable links.  
## What did I learn 
The purpose of this project was to learn about using grid for layout, and grid and flex for structuring sections of a web page.  The design wad fairly intricate which I copied from the Odin Project curriculum.  The icons wre all downloaded from Material Design Icons.  It was a learning experience not only for grid and flex, but also the use of position, margins and padding.
